# C Binary Trees Project

## Overview
- This project implements binary trees data structures and associated algorithms in C. Binary trees are versatile data structures used in various applications e.g. search algorithms, database indexing and hierarchical data representation.

## Usage
To use the binary tree functionalities;
 1. Include the 'binary_tree.h header file.
 2. Compile your code along with the binary tree source files.
 3. Use the provided functions to create, manipulate and traverse binary trees.

## File structure
- 'binary_trees.h :' Header file containing function prototypes
- 'binary_trees.c' Source file containing the implementation of binary trees functions
- 'main.c' Example file for testing the binary tree functions.
